# Snake Game #
This is a classic Snake Game created using the Python programming language and the Turtle library. 
The objective of the game is to control the movement of a snake on the screen and eat food items to grow longer. 
The game ends when the snake hits the edges of the screen or collides with its own body.

## How to Play ##
Run the `main.py` file in your Python environment.
Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.
The game starts as soon as you run the file and a food item will be randomly placed on the screen.
Eat the food item to grow longer and earn points.
The game ends when the snake hits the edges of the screen or collides with its own body.
Your high score will be displayed at the end of the game.

## Dependencies ##
